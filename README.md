# github-utils

This is a repository of utilities that use GitHub's REST API (using the PyGithub
library).

- `github-labels.py` is used to get/update the labels on a repository. The chief use
  being to synchronize labels (and colors) between repositories.
- `github-stats.py` assembles a bunch of usage metrics using the API.
