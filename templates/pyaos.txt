Hi,

MetPy 0.5.1 has been released, fixing some issues in 0.5.0:

**Impending API CHANGE** In this version we have added support for specifying (via `dim_order` keyword argument) array ordering for the 2D grid functions (`geostrophic_wind`, `advection`, `h_convergence`, `v_vorticity`, and `convergence_vorticity`). The default behavior for all releases < 0.6 has been x, then y (specified as `'xy'`). For >= 0.6, we will be changing that to `'yx'` to make it simpler to use most data sources. In this release, we will issue a warning if you are using the default ordering--this warning can be suppressed by passing the `dim_order` argument with either `'xy'` or `'yx'`, whichever is appropriate for your data.

Other fixes:
- Fixed windchill with Kelvin temperature units
- Fixed reversed ordering of GINI data y-coordinates (relative to image row order)
- Fixed inaccuracy of example code in docstrings
- Fixed `lfc()` to return NaNs instead of `None` when no LFC found
